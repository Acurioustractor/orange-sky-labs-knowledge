🎯 How we win
The way we like to work

🔻

We divide our time based on 2 types of sprints:
1. Venture Sprints
These are 3 week sprints where we run at objectives to drive our current ventures.
We follow the double diamond method to move from ideas to formed and validated services by
researching, dreaming, testing and piloting.
Want to know what we are working on right now? Check out ‘Crack on’ in the A+T ventures
workbench.
2. Core Sprints
We set aside 1 week each month to uplift the core.
We work with teams to help solve organisation problems by following Sprint methodology.

Strategic alignment: Do we have right to play, is it aligned with our vision + mission
Benefit/Impact: Is the impact the same/more or less than traditional shift? Is the reach the same,
more or less?
Cost/Implementation: How difficult or expensive will this be to implement
Confidence: How confident in the solution and it working? How confident are we that we can
mitigate the risks? How confident are we of Desirability? How confident are we of the Feasibility?
How confidence are we on Viability?

Treatment of different ventures;
1. Crack on an do “Get washing”:
Strategic alignment, high confidence, reasonable impact
a. Move into validating

2. Test and form further “let it soak’: Lower confidence or unknowns/risks to work through
b. Do further experimentation

3. Moonshot/hunt “Find the right stain remover’: Bigger plays, less confidence.
a. Hunt for partner/opportunities to shape it further

b. Senior leadership engagement - test if part of longer term strategy

4. Backlog “Leave in the washing pile”: Not a priority at the moment, either due to impact or
confidence of solution
