"It might be trite, but it’s true: we live in a rapidly changing world. And while so
many talk about innovation in dehumanised, digital terms, Orange Sky
continues to be an innovator in a human context. It is an organisation built
and run by and for people. To all our friends, supporters, staff and volunteers
– you are the reason Orange Sky exists and subsists. It’s not about the vans,
the pods, the digital platform or the t-shirts - it is about the human connection.
In a world of lockdowns, border closures and social distancing, our mission to
promote connection is suddenly even more important."

In a world of lockdowns, border closures and social distancing, our mission to
promote connection is suddenly even more important.
With all of this in mind we are launching team Delta. A team that works
collaboratively discovering, developing and

How we work:
Using our Delta Resources along with
10x $50k Ventures and 2x $250
Graduated Ventures
We work on things that should or
could do that can help us further our
mission.
We cut our work out like this:
Missions - Why we are here and
what we need to do.
Ventures - Our Ventures are our
experiments. You can find our
past, current and future ventures
Sprints - bets inside our ventures

The reason we have Delta is to run at
things that don’t need
interdependencies to the core.
We need interdependencies when we
graduate, not when we test. If we need
SME or resource from core teams
during test we must work with leaders
to agree and backfill that support.
