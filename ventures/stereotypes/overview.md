# Stereotypes

## Executive Summary
Stereotypes is an advocacy and education initiative focused on challenging harmful stereotypes about homelessness and the people experiencing it, while promoting understanding, empathy, and positive social change through authentic storytelling and community engagement.

## The Problem
- Widespread harmful stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness persist in society
- These stereotypes create barriers to support, services, and social inclusion
- Media representation often reinforces negative perceptions rather than challenging them
- People with lived experience rarely have platforms to share their authentic stories
- Stereotypes contribute to dehumanization and justify inadequate policy responses
- Community members lack opportunities to connect with and understand people experiencing homelessness

## The Opportunity
- Changing perceptions can unlock greater community support and resources
- Authentic storytelling has proven power to shift attitudes and behaviors
- Digital platforms enable wide reach and engagement with diverse audiences
- Orange Sky has trusted relationships with people who can share their stories
- Community appetite exists for more nuanced understanding of complex social issues
- Policy and funding decisions can be influenced by public perception shifts
