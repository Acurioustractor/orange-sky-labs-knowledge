# Orange Regeneration

## Executive Summary
Orange Regeneration is a sustainability initiative that creates regenerative systems and circular economy practices within Orange Sky's operations and broader community, transforming waste streams into resources while building environmental resilience and community capacity.

## The Problem
- Linear consumption models create unnecessary waste and environmental damage
- People experiencing homelessness often lack access to sustainable living options
- Community organizations struggle to implement environmentally sustainable practices
- Waste streams from services could be transformed into valuable resources
- Limited opportunities for community members to engage in environmental stewardship
- Climate change disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations including people experiencing homelessness

## The Opportunity
- Circular economy principles can reduce costs while creating community value
- Environmental sustainability can become a pathway to employment and skill development
- Community-led sustainability initiatives can build resilience and self-reliance
- Orange Sky's network can demonstrate and scale sustainable practices across the sector
- Environmental work can provide meaningful engagement and purpose for community members
- Sustainability efforts can attract new funding sources and community partnerships
