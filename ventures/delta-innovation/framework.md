# Delta Innovation Framework

## Overview
Delta is Orange Sky's innovation lab, focused on exploring adjacent opportunities and transformational ventures to expand social impact. The framework provides a systematic approach to identifying, developing, and scaling new initiatives that align with Orange Sky's mission while exploring new ways to serve the community.

## Core Philosophy

### Innovation Principles
- **Friend-Centered**: All innovation starts with understanding friend needs and experiences
- **Evidence-Based**: Decisions grounded in research, data, and proven methodologies
- **Iterative**: Rapid prototyping, testing, and learning cycles
- **Scalable**: Solutions designed for sustainable growth and widespread impact
- **Collaborative**: Co-design with stakeholders throughout the process

### Types of Innovation
1. **Adjacent Innovation**: Extensions of current services or new ways to serve existing friends
2. **Transformational Innovation**: Breakthrough approaches that could redefine social service delivery
3. **Process Innovation**: New ways of operating that improve efficiency and effectiveness
4. **Partnership Innovation**: Novel collaboration models with other organizations

## Innovation Process

### Stage 1: Discovery
