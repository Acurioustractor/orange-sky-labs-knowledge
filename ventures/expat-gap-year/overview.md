# Expat Gap Year

## Executive Summary
Expat Gap Year is an innovative volunteer engagement program that creates meaningful opportunities for international young people to contribute to Orange Sky's mission while experiencing authentic cultural exchange, personal development, and social impact work in Australia.

## The Problem

- Current gap year options can be expensive and lack social purpose

## The Opportunity

- Orange Sky's unique mission and community connections provide authentic learning opportunities
- Cultural exchange benefits both international participants and local community members
- Potential to develop future global advocates for homelessness awareness and social justice
- Opportunity to build international networks and partnerships for Orange Sky
- Model could be replicated by other social purpose organizations globally
