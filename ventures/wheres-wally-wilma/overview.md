# Where's Wally & Wilma

## Executive Summary
Where's Wally & Wilma is a research and methodology initiative that develops innovative approaches to understanding and measuring the complex experiences of people experiencing homelessness, creating more nuanced data collection methods that capture the full spectrum of human experience while respecting dignity and agency.

## The Problem
- Traditional research methods often miss the complexity and nuance of homelessness experiences
- People experiencing homelessness are frequently over-researched but under-served by research outcomes
- Existing data collection approaches can be extractive and fail to benefit participants
- Research often focuses on deficits rather than strengths, assets, and resilience
- Limited methodologies for capturing subjective experiences, emotions, and personal narratives
- Disconnect between research findings and program design or policy development
- Research participants rarely have agency in research design or benefit from outcomes

## The Opportunity
- Growing recognition of the need for participatory and community-led research approaches
- Demand for more sophisticated understanding of homelessness beyond simple statistics
- Opportunity to develop methodologies that benefit both researchers and community members
- Potential to influence how social research is conducted more broadly
- Technology enables new forms of data collection and community participation
- Increasing funding for innovative research approaches and community engagement
- Orange Sky's trusted relationships provide unique access for meaningful research
