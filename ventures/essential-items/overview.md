# Essential Items

## Executive Summary
Essential Items expands Orange Sky's material support beyond laundry services to provide access to basic necessities that help people experiencing homelessness maintain dignity, health, and stability while working toward housing solutions.

## The Problem
- People experiencing homelessness lack access to basic essential items for daily living
- Existing support often focuses on food and shelter, leaving gaps in other basic needs
- Cost and accessibility barriers prevent access to personal care items, clothing, and everyday necessities
- Lack of essential items can create barriers to employment, healthcare access, and social participation
- Current charitable provision is often inconsistent, undignified, or inadequate

## The Opportunity
- Meeting basic needs creates foundation for addressing more complex challenges
- Essential items can be integrated with existing Orange Sky service delivery
- Dignified provision of necessities supports self-esteem and wellbeing
- Strategic provision can address specific barriers to housing and employment
- Technology can improve efficiency and tracking of item distribution
