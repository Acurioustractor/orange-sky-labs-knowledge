- **Focus**: 2-3 most relevant documents rather than everything
- **Reference**: Document names and repository structure

### **"Implementation Seems Overwhelming"**
- **Solution**: Ask for phased approach starting with one framework
- **Focus**: Quick wins and pilot projects
- **Request**: 30-day action plan rather than complete transformation
