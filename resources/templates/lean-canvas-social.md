## üìù USAGE NOTES

### **Best Practices**:
- Start with the problem and beneficiaries - everything else flows from there
- Be specific about your target population rather than trying to help everyone
- Focus on evidence-based assumptions that can be tested
- Keep financial projections realistic and conservative
- Plan for multiple funding sources to reduce risk

### **Common Pitfalls**:
- Making solution too complex or trying to solve everything at once
- Underestimating true costs of service delivery
- Overestimating willingness to pay or fund
- Not clearly defining success metrics
- Ignoring competitive or similar solutions

### **Adaptation Guidelines**:
- Modify sections to fit your specific context
- Add additional stakeholder categories if needed
- Include regulatory or compliance considerations
- Adapt metrics to your sector and impact model
- Consider cultural and local context factors
